# VocaBalloons!

## My first project for the Ironhack Coding Bootcamp

In this project, I used the P5 library with JavaScript, HTML and CSS to create a vocabulary learning game, inspired by the Gravity game on Quizlet.com. 
While playing, words from a chosen vocabulary set fall down from the top of the screen with increasing speed as the game progresses. 
Players must type in the correct translation of the word before it touches the bottom of the screen or they will lose a life.
